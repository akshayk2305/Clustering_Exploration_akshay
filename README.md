 For this task, we were required to apply various clustering algorithms, employ diverse pre-processing techniques, and assess different numbers of clusters across various evaluation parameters.

 Dataset - Iris

 I've employed three clustering methods: K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

 I have considered the following parameters: Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin.

 I have applied the following pre-processing techniques: Normalization, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Transformation, and Scaling.

 Below are the graphs depicting various clustering algorithms:
